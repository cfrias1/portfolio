# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
I think the largest changes I've made since Part II was actually creating the Shorthand and data visualizations in Flourish/Tableau. That allowed me to get a better idea on what was still needed. And one thing I felt was still needed was just general images/icons; my mock-up in part II had a lot of white space (which makes sense given I hand drew it) and it became very noticable once it was transferred over to Shorthand. So, I added some images to help fill it out a little more.

## The audience
My intended audience remains current and future working professionals in the public sector. I've mentioned a lot of current government programs that could possibly ring a bell and establish some familiarity, I referenced data from a federal agency and some polls, talked about important policy considerations, etc. Nothing was too "in the weeds" for someone who has at least somewhat of a background in the public sector. 

## Final design decisions
Speaking as someone who works in State Government supporting a lot of these social programs, I wanted to communicate how needlessly complicated they are and how difficult it is to actually get approved for benefits. I used a road analogy to try and represent hurdles/obstacles in the road to receiving benefits but I'm not sure how well that translated from my conception in Part II versus the actual shorthand story. Like many others, I kept a black/white theme for the most part where the beginning primarily has darker backgrounds to represent some "doom and gloom" and then shifts to a white background as we talk exclusively about UBI. I also purposefully used a lot of hyperlinks, in the hopes that I could have one sentence summaries of those links and give the viewer the possibility of going down that rabbit-hole should they wish - not sure if more text/context in the actual shorthand would have been benefitical. 

## References
There is a reference list in my shorthand!

# Final thoughts
Overall, I think there's a lot more that could be done but I'm out of time. I think some of the opportunities from the feedback collected in part II, such as continuing the road analogy throughout the shorthand, adding more call out infographics and supporting data, and improving just general design elements, would be extremely beneficial. But I feel constrained by time and a little bit by the software, namely shorthand. It's probably an issue of just me not being familiar enough with shorthand/not spending enough time digging into it and me having a PowerPoint mindset since that's what I've all my life, but I felt like I frequently had design ideas that I wanted to work into the narrative but couldn't figure out how to make it work in Shorthand/Flourish/etc. I even tried doing some designs manually in PowerPoint to see if I could just transfer an image over into Shorthand but the image quality was noticeably different from the rest of the presentation that I ultimately felt like I had to remove it. There's tons of other software options out there that probably could have done what I envisioned based on how some of my classmates' presentations looked like, but alas, potentially something for another day.
