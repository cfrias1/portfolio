# Outline

1. Current Social Safety Net is Not Sufficient
   - Show COVID's disruptive effect on unemployment, food security, etc.
2. Current Social Safety Net is Too Complex and Ineffective
   - Show how many overlapping and conflicting programs exist in the current government safety net
   - Show some measure on effectiveness of one or so programs
3. A More Efficient Approach is Possible - Universal Basic Income/Guaranteed Income
   - Show CARES' extended UI benefits'/cash stipends' effect on poverty
   - Show other research on direct cash assistance benefit
4. Universal Basic Income is Growing in Popularity
   - Show map of various pilots / potentially include some historical context?
   - Show some poll results
   - Call to Action / Show current considerations of legislation

**Story Arc from Class**
Direct Cash Assistance is the most effective tool at reducing poverty. As a reader, I want to understand why cash assistance is more effective than the programs currently in existence and understand its growing popularity. I can do this by supporting politicians/policies that push direct cash assistance programs.

# The data

So, just some general data to use to demonstrate pandemic's impact on unemployment rate and food insecurity.
> [“Local Area Unemployment Statistics”, 2022, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LASST250000000000003?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&output_view=data&include_graphs=true)

> [“Household Pulse Survey Data Tables”, 2022, United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data.html)

Kind of shady looking website, but it serves as a nice jumping off point and has a lot of things conveniently together (like a list of large government programs).
> [“Welfare Issues”, Accessed 2022, Federal Safety Net](https://federalsafetynet.com/welfare-issues/)

Census data, easy, to show changes in official and SPM poverty rates and there's additional discussion on how pandemic relief spending, mainly stipends and expanded UI benefits, had huge impacts on these measures.
> [Creamer, John, Emily A. Shrider, Kaylee Burns, and Frances Chen, 2022, “Poverty in the United State: 2021 Current Population Reports” (Report No. P60-277), United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2022/demo/p60-277.pdf)

One data source to show poll populariy of UBI. Will likely add other sources in final version.
> [Penumaka, Evangel, Isa Alomran, and Abby Steckel, 2021, “Majority of Voters Support a Guaranteed Income”,  Data For Progress](https://www.filesforprogress.org/memos/voters-support-a-guaranteed-income.pdf)

Some data sources to show number of/sheer vastness of running/completed pilots. Will likely adapt data into own visual.
> [“The Guaranteed Income Pilots Dashboard”, 2022,  Guaranteed Income Pilots Dashboard](https://guaranteedincome.us/)

> [Stanford Basic Income Lab [cartographer]. (2020). Global Map of Basic Income Experiments](https://basicincome.stanford.edu/research/basic-income-experiments/)

Some results from one pilot program - will continue search for other sources to help show overall effectiveness.

# Method and medium
I've never used shorthand before so I imagine I'll be giving that a try. Just from the little intro video, it seems like a fancier powerpoint that could possibly self transition, so I'll have to experiment with timing potentially, but also there's possiblity for just overall a lot more flare than your standard powerpoint. I think it also should offer a lot of flexibility to have the visuals be the focal point and have supplemental text that can be expanded on/highled by the viewer if wished. So I'll give it a try and see what happens.
