# About me
Hi! My name is Christopher Frias - both Chris and Christopher are fine - and I'm currently in my second (and final!) year of my [graduate school program](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/public-policy-management-master/). I am also a part-time financial consultant for the Division of Child Care at the [Arizona Department of Economic Security](https://des.az.gov/), where I've worked for nearly five years. Professionally, I'm passionate about social policy - specifically policy related to poverty reduction through direct cash assistance. My pronouns are he/him/his. 

# What I hope to learn
In general, I want to become better at conveying strong/clear messages through data visualization. In my government work, a common challenge I've experienced is taking a complicated subject or a set of financial information or programmatic metrics and communicating it an audience who may not be as well versed in the fine workings of this particular government program. Basically: how can I move away from simply presenting a table full of numbers and instead provide something that has more nuance and meaning? That's the goal.
