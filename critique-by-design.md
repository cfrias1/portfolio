# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design
## Step one: find a data visualization
The below data visualization is a table that I created in my job as a financial analyst/consultant for Arizona's Child Care Subsidy program; it's meant to show the YTD expenses, last communicated "planned" amount in a formal infrastructure plan document, the current forecast, and how the current forecast is spread out among the various fund sources for the initiatives undertaken using COVID relief funds. It has been in use and consistently updated/edited for the past 2 or so years.
